(* < User Prompt > *)
(*     You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than *)
(*     zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. *)
(*     The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list. *)
(*     If no such a value exist, return -1. *)
(*     Examples: *)
(*     >>> search [4; 1; 2; 2; 3; 1] *)
(*     2 *)
(*     >>> search [1; 2; 2; 3; 3; 3; 4; 4; 4] *)
(*     3 *)
(*     >>> search [5; 5; 4; 4; 4] *)
(*     (-1) *)

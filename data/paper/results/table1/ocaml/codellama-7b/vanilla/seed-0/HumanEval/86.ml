(* < User Prompt > *)
(*     Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it. *)
(*     Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space) *)
(*     are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in *)
(*     ascending order based on ascii value. *)
(*     Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence. *)
(*     For example: *)
(*     >>> anti_shuffle "Hi" *)
(*     "Hi" *)
(*     >>> anti_shuffle "hello" *)
(*     "ehllo" *)
(*     >>> anti_shuffle "Hello World!!!" *)
(*     "Hello !!!Wdlor" *)

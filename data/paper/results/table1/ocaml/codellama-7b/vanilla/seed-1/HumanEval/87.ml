(* < User Prompt > *)
(*     You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists, *)
(*     which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices, *)
(*     each row may contain a different number of columns. *)
(*     Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list, *)
(*     and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that *)
(*     each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0. *)
(*     Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order. *)
(*     Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order. *)
(*     Examples: *)
(*     >>> get_row [[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]; [1; 2; 3; 4; 1; 6]; [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 1]] 1 *)
(*     [(0, 0); (1, 4); (1, 0); (2, 5); (2, 0)] *)
(*     >>> get_row [] 1 *)
(*     [] *)
(*     >>> get_row [[]; [1]; [1; 2; 3]] 3 *)
(*     [(2, 2)] *)

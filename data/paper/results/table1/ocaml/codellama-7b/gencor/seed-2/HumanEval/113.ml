(*     Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list. *)
(*     Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the *)
(*     string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number *)
(*     of odd digits in the i'th string of the input. *)
(*     >>> odd_count ["1234567"] *)
(*     ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."] *)
(*     >>> odd_count ["3"; "11111111"] *)
(*     ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput."; "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."] *)

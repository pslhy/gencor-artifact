(* < User Prompt > *)
(*     Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter, *)
(*     and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even *)
(*     or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise. *)
(*     i starts from 1. *)
(*     the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i). *)
(*     Example: *)
(*     >>> f 5 *)
(*     [1; 2; 6; 24; 15] *)

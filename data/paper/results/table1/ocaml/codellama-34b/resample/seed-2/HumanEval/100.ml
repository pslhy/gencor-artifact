(*     Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones. *)
(*     The first level has n stones. *)
(*     The number of stones in the next level is: *)
(*     - the next odd number if n is odd. *)
(*     - the next even number if n is even. *)
(*     Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index *)
(*     i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1). *)

(*     This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that *)
(*     l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal *)
(*     to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted. *)
(*     >>> sort_even [1; 2; 3] *)
(*     [1; 2; 3] *)
(*     >>> sort_even [5; 6; 3; 4] *)
(*     [3; 6; 5; 4] *)

(* < User Prompt > *)
(*     In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges *)
(*     that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains *)
(*     apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of *)
(*     the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits *)
(*     in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket. *)
(*     for examble: *)
